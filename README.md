🧠 Disease Prediction Toolkit

This project is a machine learning-based toolkit designed to predict diabetes using health-related data. It demonstrates end-to-end implementation including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

📂 Dataset

The dataset used is `diabetes.csv`, which includes features such as:
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- BMI
- Age
- Insulin
- Skin Thickness

The target variable is `Outcome`, indicating whether a person is diabetic (1) or not (0).

🛠️ Models Used

Three classification models were implemented and compared:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

Each model was trained on scaled features and evaluated using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC AUC.

📈 Evaluation

Performance of each model was visualized using:
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve
